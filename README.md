# PHP Search Algorithms App

This PHP application allows users to explore and compare four different search algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, Jump Search, and Exponential Search. The app displays whether a target value is found in the array, along with detailed information about each algorithm's time complexity, space complexity, stability, and whether sorting is required.

## Features

- **Search Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search, Jump Search, Exponential Search.
- **Trace Output**: Shows if the target value is found, along with its index.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Displays time complexity, space complexity, and whether the array needs to be sorted.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Youssefkhaled74/Php-QMBIS-Sort-Algorithms.git
